To build and install kivaloo, run:
# make BINDIR=/path/to/target/directory install

Kivaloo should build and run on any IEEE Std 1003.1 (POSIX) compliant system
which includes the Software Development Utilities and Threads options.  If it
doesn't, this is a bug -- please report it!


Tests
-----

Tests involving AWS require additional setup.

First, you must have AWS access keys.  If you use the web console, this is
under "My Security Credentials"->"Access keys for CLI, SDK, & API access".  For
kivaloo, that info should be saved in a text file with the form:
    ACCESS_KEY_ID=...
    ACCESS_KEY_SECRET=...
(with no leading spaces)

- tests/s3: you must:
  1) have a ~/.s3/aws.key file which contains the access key.
  2) have a unique S3 bucket name in AWS.
  3) specify the bucket name as the BUCKET environment variable, for example:

      $ BUCKET=kivaloo-test-john-smith make test

  4) you might be required to specify a REGION environment variable, for
     example:

      $ REGION=us-east-1 make test

     The default region varies based on the test directory, so if in doubt,
     check test_s3.sh.

- tests/kvlds-ddbkv: you must:
  1) have a ~/.dynamodb/aws.key which contains the access key.
  2) have a unique DynamodDB table name in AWS, with a partition key `K`.
  3) specify the two table names as the TABLE and TABLEM environment
     variables, for example:

      $ TABLE=kivaloo-testing-john-smith \
        TABLEM=kivaloo-testing-m-john-smith \
	make test

  4) you might be required to specify a REGION environment variable, for
     example:

      $ REGION=us-west-2 make test

     The default region varies based on the test directory, so if in doubt,
     check test_kvlds.sh.


Platform-specific notes
-----------------------

- The performance of SSL networking can be improved if SO_NOSIGPIPE is
  available in <sys/socket.h>.  To get this in FreeBSD, define __BSD_VISIBLE,
  for example:
      make CFLAGS="-O2 -g -D__BSD_VISIBLE"
