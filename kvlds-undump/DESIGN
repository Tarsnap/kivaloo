KVLDS-UNDUMP design
===================

The kvlds-undump utility is invoked as
# kivaloo-kvlds-undump -t <kvlds socket> [--fs <dir>]

It opens a connection to the specified KVLDS daemon and writes a series of
key-value pairs.  By default the key-value pairs are read from stdin; if the
--fs <dir> option is specified, subdirectories of <dir> will be processed,
with keys and values read from files named "k" and "v".
