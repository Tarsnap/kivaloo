LBS design
==========

The lbs block store is invoked as

# kivaloo-lbs -s <lbs socket> -d <storage dir> -b <block size> [-1] [-L]
      [-n <# of readers>] [-p <pidfile>] [-l <extra read latency in ns>]

It creates a socket <lbs socket> on which it listens for incoming connections
and accepts one at a time.  It stores data in files under the directory
<storage dir>, using aligned I/Os of size <block size> or multiples thereof.
At most one APPEND operation and at most one FREE operation will be performed
at a time; but an unlimited number of GET operations may be pending and as
many as <# of readers> will be performed simultaneously.  The process ID will
be written to <pidfile> or to <lbs socket>.pid if the -p option is not
specified.  (Note that if <lbs socket> is IP:port or hostname:port rather
than an absolute path, the default pid file will be in the current directory.)

As debugging aids, the -1 option will cause lbs to exit after handling a
single connection; the -l option will cause lbs read operations to sleep the
specified duration before returning results; and the -L option will cause lbs
to operate in data-loss mode, i.e., without using fsync.

Overview
--------

LBS works with a hybrid events/threaded model.  A master thread runs in an
event loop to handle communication, but hands off potentially-blocking disk
operations to worker threads -- one thread for APPEND operations, one thread
for FREE operations, and multiple threads for READ operations.  When a worker
thread has completed an operation, it wakes up the master thread, which sends
a reponse to the client and schdules more work for the thread (if there is
work queued awaiting an available thread).

The standard pthreads routines are used for thread management and locking:
pthread_thread_create for creating threads, pthread_mutex_(lock|unlock) for
controlling access to a thread's control data; pthread_cond_(wait|signal) for
waking up a thread when it has work to do; and pthread_rwlock_(rd|wr|un)lock
for controlling access to back-end storage state (i.e., information about
which blocks are stored in which files).

Code structure
--------------

main.c		-- Processes command line, creates a listening socket,
		   daemonizes, accepts one connection at once, and runs the
		   event loop.
dispatch.c	-- Reads requests from a connection and drops the connection
		   if one cannot be read.
dispatch_request.c
		-- Handles request packets, either sending a response back
		   immediately or handing the request off to a worker thread.
dispatch_response.c
		-- Sends responses after worker threads finish work.
worker.c	-- Creates, assigns work to, runs, and returns work completed
		   by worker threads.
storage.c	-- Back-end work management: Map block read/write/free to
		   operations on files.
storage_findfiles.c
		-- Look through the storage directory and return a list of
		   block file names and sizes.  (Initialization only.)
storage_util.c	-- Utility functions for storage.c.
disk.c		-- Reads and writes files, and fsyncs directories.
