KVLDS design
============

The kvlds log-structured key-value store is invoked as

# kivaloo-kvlds -s <kvlds socket> -l <lbs socket> [-C <npages> | -c <pagemem>]
      [-k <max key length>] [-v <max value length>] [-p <pidfile>]
      [-S <storage:I/O cost ratio>] [-w <commit delay time>]
      [-g <min forced commit size>] [-1]

It creates a socket at the address <kvlds socket> on which it listens for
incoming connections and accepts one at a time.  It connects to a block store
at the address <lbs socket> and uses that for backing storage.  These socket
addresses may be expressed in the form hostname:port (if the hostname resolves
to multiple addresses, only the first will be listened on), [ip]:port, or
/path/to/unix/socket.

The other options are:
  -C <npages>
	Hold up to <npages> B+Tree nodes in RAM at once.  May not be
	specified if -c <pagemem> is specified.
  -c <pagemem>
	Hold <pagemem> / <page size> B+Tree nodes in RAM at once.  May not be
	specified if -C <npages> is specified.  Defaults to -c 128M or
	SIZE_MAX, whichever is lower.  Note that the total RAM used may exceed
	the -c option by as much as a factor of 2 depending on the memory
	allocator used and the average key and value lengths.
  -k <max key length>
	Reject an attempt to write keys longer than <max key length> bytes.
	Defaults to -k 64, -k 128, or -k 255 for block sizes of 512+,
	1024+, and 2048+ respectively.
  -v <max value length>
	Reject an attempt to store values longer than <max value length>
	bytes.  Defaults to -v 96, -v 192, or -v 255 for block sizes of
	512+, 1024+, and 2048+ respectively.
  -p <pidfile>
	Write the daemon's process ID to the file <pidfile>.  Defaults to
	-p <kvlds socket>.pid.  (Note that if <kvlds socket> is not an
	absolute path, the default pid file location is in the current
	directory.)
  -S <storage:I/O cost ratio>
	Cost of one GB-month of storage divided by the cost of 10^6 I/Os.
	Used to control how aggressive the background log cleaner is.  Good
	values range from 0.08 (3 TB SATA with 100 random I/Os per second)
	up to 1600 (40 GB SSD with 25k random I/Os per second).  Setting
	-S 0 disables background log cleaning.  Defaults to 1.0 (which is a
	good value for Amazon EBS).
  -w <commit delay time>
	Wait up to <commit delay time> seconds before triggering a group
	commit.  This may be useful in cases where block store writes are
	expensive.  Defaults to -w 0.
  -g <min forced commit size>
	Force a group commit when <min forced commit size> operations are
	pending even if the commit delay timer hasn't expired.  This can be
	used to obtain high performance bulk writes despite the -w option.
  -1
	Exit after handling one connection.

Definitions
-----------

* A "node" is a B+Tree node.
* A "page" is the serialization of a node.
* A "block" is the storage into which a page is written.

Balancing conditions
--------------------

We use relaxed balancing conditions in order to reduce the frequency with
which nodes are split and joined.  We claim without proof that this provides
a worst-case amortized number of rebalancing operations per request within a
constant factor of the average case, in contrast to standard B+tree balancing
conditions which can result in rebalancing being required after every
operation.

1. A parent has at least one child.  (In a normal B+Tree, there is usually a
   higher occupancy required.)
2. A non-leaf root has at least two children.  (As with normal B+Trees.)
3. The serialization of any node is at most equal to the block size.  (As
   with normal B+Trees.)
4. Any pair of adjacent children of a parent node, if merged, would produce a
   node with serialized size greater than 2/3 of the LBS block size.  (In
   a normal B+Tree there is a minimum occupancy ratio for each individual
   node.)

Note that a leaf node may be empty (but will usually end up being merged with
an adjacent node before long).

Key/value size bounds
---------------------

In order for the node-splitting algorithm (in btree_node_split.c) to work,
we require that adding another key-value pair to a node which is below the
split threshold (pagelen * 2/3) will not take it above the maximum size;
i.e., that
  serialized key length + serialized value length <= pagelen / 3

If a parent node with 3 maximum-length keys (and 4 children) has serialized
size at most 2/3 of the LBS block size, then the number of non-overlapping
pairs of adjacent parent nodes doubles at each level (each pair of adjacent
parent nodes must have at least 5 children in total between them forming two
non-overlapping pairs).  Any lesser bound is not sufficient to guarantee that
the tree will have logarithmic height; consequently we require
  serialized key length
      <= (pagelen * 2/3 - overhead - 4 * serialized child pointer length) / 3

Some reasonable combinations of page sizes and maximum key/value lengths:

  Block size    Key length    Value length
  ----------    ----------    ------------
      512           32             128
      512           64             96
     1024           64             255
     1024          128             192
     2048+         255             255

Log-structured B+Tree
---------------------

Following standard practice for log-structured B+Trees, kvlds uses COW
(copy-on-write) semantics.  When a modifying request affects a node for the
first time, the node and its ancestors are "dirtied": The existing nodes are
marked as "shadow", and newly created copies is marked as "dirty".

While modifying requests are being processed, there are two overlapping trees:
The "shadow tree" and the "dirty tree".  After a batch of modifying requests
have been processed, dirty nodes are written out to the block store and then
marked as clean; shadow nodes are freed.

Non-modifying requests are performed within the shadow tree (i.e., on the
most recent *committed* data).

Node locking
------------

A subset of the dirty and shadow trees is kept in RAM.  Nodes can be locked
into RAM; those which are not locked may be evicted when a new node is
allocated or loaded from the backing storage.

Nodes are locked:
* If they are roots.
* If they are not clean.
* If they have paged-in children.
* If they are clean leaf nodes owned by the log cleaner.
* If they are owned by the modifying-request processing code.
* If there is a btree_node_descend call in progress on the node.

Note that btree_node_descend calls "complete" (in the sense of invoking their
callbacks) via priority 0 immediate events once the node in question is paged
in; so if a priority 1+ immediate event is run and a node is paged in, said
node is guaranteed to not have any in-progress btree_node_descend calls.

Tree dancing
------------

KVLDS performs B+Tree operations in batches, rebalancing after each batch
before syncing.  This extends the widely-used "group commit" method and
improves performance in the context of non-zero latency disk operations, but
makes the rebalancing more complex.

Define: A node is *splittable* if it has serialized size greater than the LBS
block size.
Define: A series of adjacent nodes x[0]..x[i-1] with the same parent are
*mergable* if merging them would produce a node with serialized size at most
2/3 of the LBS block size.

The algorithm used for rebalancing is as follows:
1. Split: Traverse the dirty subtree in depth-first postorder, splitting any
   nodes which are splittable.  (If the root needs to be split, add a new
   root.)
2. Merge: Traverse the dirty subtree in depth-first postorder, merging any
   mergable sets of nodes to create a new DIRTY node.  If a (non newly
   created) DIRTY node has no DIRTY children, mark it as MERGED.
3. If the root node is not marked as MERGED, goto 2.
4. Deroot: While the tree root is a parent with only one child, delete the
   root and promote the child to roothood.

If a tree starts out satisfying the balacing conditions, has key-value pairs
added/modified/deleted in its leaf nodes, and then is rebalanced, it will end
up satisfying the balancing conditions:
1. Modifying leaf nodes does not affect parent nodes; Split and Deroot
   never reduce the number of children of a parent node; and Merge will never
   reduce the number of children below 1.
2. Deroot restores this condition, and is the last step.
3. In the Split stage, the only time a node size increases is when one of
   its children is split.  Because we operate in depth-first postorder, nodes
   are considered for splitting after the last time (in the Split stage)
   when their size might be increased; hence after the end of the Split
   stage, this condition is satisfied.
   In the Merge stages, we never merge nodes if it would create a new node
   larger than 2/3 of the LBS block size; thus we will not cause this
   condition to be violated.
   The Deroot stage does not increase the size of a node, and thus cannot
   cause this condition to be violated.
4. Any mergable nodes after a Merge stage has been performed will be children
   of a newly created node.  Said node will be DIRTY; so its ancestors up to
   the root will be DIRTY; and it will be visited on the next Merge pass and
   the mergable nodes will be merged.  Thus this condition will be satisfied
   at the end of step 3.
   The Deroot stage does not act on nodes with siblings, so it cannot cause
   any nodes to become mergable.

We claim, without proof, that the Merge stage will be run at most O(h)
times; and at most O(N h) nodes will be modified, where N is the number of
leaves touched and h is the height of the tree.
