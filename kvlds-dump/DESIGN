KVLDS-DUMP design
=================

The kvlds-dump utility is invoked as
# kivaloo-kvlds-dump -t <kvlds socket> [--fs <dir>]

It opens a connection to the specified KVLDS daemon and retrieves all of the
key-value pairs.  By default the key-value pairs are written to stdout; if
the --fs <dir> option is specified, numbered directories will be created
under that directory containing files named "k" and "v" with the keys and
values respectively.
