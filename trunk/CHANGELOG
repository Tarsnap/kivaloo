kivaloo-1.1.0
* struct kvldskey is no longer reference counted.
* struct kvldskey is asserted to be identical to its serialization.
* kvldskey_cmp2 is now significantly faster.
* keys used in dispatch_nmr.c RANGE code are duplicated rather than being
  referenced.
* struct kvpair_const is added, equal to struct kvlds with const key+value.
* kvlds nodes point into serialized pages for keys/values rather than using
  malloced kvldskey structures.
* (struct node).pagebuf added to store serialized pages (now that we keep
  them around rather than copying keys into new structures).
* added proto_lbs_request_append_blks function which takes an array of page
  buffer pointers.
* btree_sync collects pointers to page buffers instead of having pages
  serialized into one giant buffer, and uses proto_lbs_reqeust_append_blks.
* (struct node).mlen renamed to mlen_t.
* (struct node).mlen_n added equal to the length of the prefix shared by all
  the keys present in a leaf node.
* bit-field types in struct node are made unsigned and widths are adjusted.
* adding a new key to a leaf node refactored from dispatch_mr.c into new
  btree_mutate_add function.
* nodedup refactored into btree_node_dirty.
* several loops of copying key/value/node pointers replaced by memcpy calls.
* kvldskey_sep is removed; split_leaf just uses the larger of the two keys as
  the separator (necessary because keys in nodes are no longer malloced).
