kivaloo-s3 design
=================

The kivaloo-s3 daemon is invoked as

# kivaloo-s3 -s <s3 socket> -r <S3 region> -k <keyfile> [-1]
    [-n <max # connections>] [-p <pidfile>]

It creates a socket <s3 socket> on which it listens for incoming connections
and accepts one at a time.  It reads S3 keys from the file <keyfile>, which
must have lines ACCESS_KEY_ID=<keyid> and ACCESS_KEY_SECRET=<secret>, and uses
these to make requests to the S3 region <S3 region>.

The other options are:
  -l <logfile>
	Log S3 requests to <logfile>.
  -n <max # connections>
	Open at most <max # connections> connections to S3 at once.  Defaults
	to 16 connections.
  -p <pidfile>
	Write the daemon's process ID to the file <pidfile>.  Defaults to
	-p <s3 socket>.pid.  (Note that if <s3 socket> is not an absolute path,
	the default pid file location is in the current directory.)
  -1
	Exit after handling one connection.

S3 regions
----------

The names of S3 regions are the names of AWS regions, e.g., "us-east-1",
"ap-northeast-1", et cetera.  Note that all incoming requests must be for
buckets in the region the kivaloo-s3 daemon is configured to send requests
to, as it will not obey HTTP 301 or 307 redirections and will not sign
requests appropriately for other regions.

Note also that the "s3" (aka. US Standard) region has (as of 2012-03-17)
weaker consistency guarantees than other S3 regions: All other S3 regions have
strong read-after-create consistency while the US Standard S3 region has only
eventual consistency.  This makes the "s3" region unusable for applications
which rely on read-after-create consistency (e.g., kivaloo-lbs-s3).

Code structure
--------------

main.c		-- Processes command line, creates an S3 request queue,
		   creates a listening socket, daemonizes, starts DNS lookups,
		   accepts one connection at once, and runs the event loop.
dns.c		-- Performs an initial (blocking) DNS lookup, then forks off a
		   child to perform more DNS lookups.  Adds the addresses to
		   the S3 request queue.
dispatch.c	-- Reads requests from a connection and drops the connection
		   if one cannot be read.
dispatch_request.c
		-- Handles incoming requests, translating them and queueing
		   them into the S3 request queue.
dispatch_response.c
		-- Handles completed S3 operations, translating resopnses and
		   sending them back to the client.
